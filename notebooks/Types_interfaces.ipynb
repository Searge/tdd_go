The type set defined by such an interface is the set of types which implement all of those methods, and the corresponding [method set](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_sets) consists exactly of the methods specified by the interface. Interfaces whose type sets can be defined entirely by a list of methods are called _basic interfaces._\n",
