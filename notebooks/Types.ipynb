    "A type determines a set of values together with operations and methods specific to those values. A type may be denoted by a _type name_, if it has one, which must be followed by [type arguments](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Instantiations) if the type is generic. A type may also be specified using a _type literal_, which composes a type from existing types.\n",

    "Type      = TypeName [ TypeArgs ] | TypeLit | \"(\" Type \")\" .\n",

    "The language [predeclares](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers) certain type names. Others are introduced with [type declarations](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_declarations) or [type parameter lists](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_parameter_declarations). _Composite types_—array, struct, pointer, function, interface, slice, map, and channel types—may be constructed using type literals.\n",

    "Predeclared types, defined types, and type parameters are called _named types_. An alias denotes a named type if the type given in the alias declaration is a named type."
