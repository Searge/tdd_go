    "## Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is specified using a [variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth_syntax_notation) of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):\n",
    "\n",
    "```ebnf\n",
    "Syntax      = { Production } .\n",
    "Production  = production_name \"=\" [ Expression ] \".\" .\n",
    "Expression  = Term { \"|\" Term } .\n",
    "Term        = Factor { Factor } .\n",
    "Factor      = production_name | token [ \"…\" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .\n",
    "Group       = \"(\" Expression \")\" .\n",
    "Option      = \"[\" Expression \"]\" .\n",
    "Repetition  = \"{\" Expression \"}\" .\n",
    "```\n",
    "Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following operators, in increasing precedence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ebnf\n",
    "|   alternation\n",
    "()  grouping\n",
    "[]  option (0 or 1 times)\n",
    "{}  repetition (0 to n times)\n",

    "Lowercase production names are used to identify lexical (terminal) tokens. Non-terminals are in CamelCase. Lexical tokens are enclosed in double quotes `\"\"` or back quotes ` `` `.\n",
    "\n",
    "The form `a … b` represents the set of characters from `a` through `b` as alternatives. The horizontal ellipsis `…` is also used elsewhere in the spec to informally denote various enumerations or code snippets that are not further specified. The character `…` (as opposed to the three characters `...`) is not a token of the Go language.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens form the vocabulary of the Go language. There are four classes: identifiers, keywords, operators and punctuation, and literals. White space, formed from spaces (U+0020), horizontal tabs (U+0009), carriage returns (U+000D), and newlines (U+000A), is ignored except as it separates tokens that would otherwise combine into a single token. Also, a newline or end of file may trigger the insertion of a semicolon. While breaking the input into tokens, the next token is the longest sequence of characters that form a valid token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types. An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits. The first character in an identifier must be a letter.\n",

    "### Semicolons\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal syntax uses semicolons `\";\"` as terminators in a number of productions. Go programs may omit most of these semicolons using the following two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the input is broken into tokens, a semicolon is automatically inserted into the token stream immediately after a line's final token if that token is\n",

    "    - one of the [keywords](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Keywords) `break`, `continue`, `fallthrough`, or `return`\n",
    "    - one of the [operators and punctuation](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operators_and_punctuation) `++`, `--`, `)`, `]`, or `}`\n",
    "2. To allow complex statements to occupy a single line, a semicolon may be omitted before a closing `\")\"` or `\"}\"`.\n",
