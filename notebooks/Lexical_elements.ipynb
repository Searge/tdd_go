    "## Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens form the vocabulary of the Go language. There are four classes: identifiers, keywords, operators and punctuation, and literals. White space, formed from spaces (U+0020), horizontal tabs (U+0009), carriage returns (U+000D), and newlines (U+000A), is ignored except as it separates tokens that would otherwise combine into a single token. Also, a newline or end of file may trigger the insertion of a semicolon. While breaking the input into tokens, the next token is the longest sequence of characters that form a valid token.\n",

    "### Semicolons\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal syntax uses semicolons `\";\"` as terminators in a number of productions. Go programs may omit most of these semicolons using the following two rules:\n",

    "    - one of the [operators and punctuation](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operators_and_punctuation) `++`, `--`, `)`, `]`, or `}`\n",
