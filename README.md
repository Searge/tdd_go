[![Learn Go with Tests](assets/tdd_go.jpg)](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)

This is a collection of [Go](https://golang.org) code examples that show how to write [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) tests.

## Progress

1. **Helloworld**: Completed implementation of the [Hello](helloworld/hello.go:14:0-20:1) function with tests for different languages (English, Spanish, French) and default behavior for empty input.
2. **Integers**: Implemented the [Add](integers/adder.go:5:0-12:1) function with tests for basic arithmetic operations and logging of results.
   1. **Examples**: Completed implementation of the `ByAge` struct and its methods for sorting a slice of [Person](examples/sort_test.go:7:0-10:1) structs by age.
